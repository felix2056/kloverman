            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>Klover Sales began in 2007 with an aim to supply Canada’s chefs with an attractive alternative to
                disposable tableware as the Canadian distributor for the French company FirstPack. Our idea is simple:
                the clean and minimal design of our products creates value for chefs by enhancing their food
                presentation. It is our goal to provide chefs and foodservice professionals in Canada with easy access
                to great products.</p>
            <p>Over the past years Klover Sales has become the Canadian distributor for FirstPack’s US division,
                Packnwood and we have expanded, becoming a leading supplier for the country’s top chefs, restaurants and
                caterers. We value our chefs, and that’s why we make customer service a priority. Shop online, or <a

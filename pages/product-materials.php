            <h2>Bamboo</h2>
            <p>Bamboo is the fastest growing plant on the planet, growing as large as 24 inches every day. Needing very
                little water to do so and absolutely zero chemicals. It is 100% biodegradable when used alone. It is one
                of the most popular materials that make up our products.</p>
            <h2>Sugarcane</h2>
            <p>Sugarcane, also called Pulp or Bagasse, comes from the natural residue of the Sugarcane harvest.
                Previously this material was considered useless and destroyed, but now there are many good uses for it,
                and it is 100% biodegradable and compostable when used alone.</p>
            <h2>Cornstarch</h2>
            <p>Once cornstarch is converted to a thermoplastic polyester known as PLA, it is as strong as regular
                plastic except it is completely compostable. Though it can't withstand high temperatures, PLA is a
                versatile material that can be used in a variety of ways.</p>
            <h2>Wood</h2>
            <p>Our wood products come from wood from specially curated forests located all over the world. Whether it is
                birch, poplar or pinewood, our extensive line of wood products will add a smooth and sophisticated touch
                to your tableware presentation.</p>
            <h2>Recycled &amp; Recyclable Plastic</h2>
            <p>Polyethylene terephthalate, or PET is a recycled plastic made from fossil fuels like natural gas that are
                used to make transparent products. PET continues to be recyclable, ensuring that the material is
                sustainable and leaves the smallest possible footprint on the environment.</p>
            <h2>Palm</h2>
            <p>Without cutting down a tree, producers collect the sheaths of a palm tree, which naturally dry, fall, and
                regenerate all on their own. Those sheathes are cleaned in fresh spring water, and become elegant and
                eco-friendly bowls and plates.</p>
            <h2>Cardboard &amp; Paper</h2>
            <p>Our Cardboard and Paper products are natural and recyclable, and are an affordable Green alternative to
                plastic.</p>
